Conventions:

- Strings are numbered from 0 to N, with 0 being the lowest pitched string

### Tuning t

    t = [[interval, ]...]

There are (strings - 1) intervals.

The default guitar tuning is:

    [4P, 4P, 4P, 3M, 4P]

in semitones:

    [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] = 24 semitones = 2 octaves  

Given a tuning t, define the following formulas:

### note = f(string, fret)

TODO

### interval = f(fromString, fromFret, toString, toFret)

TODO

### fret = f(note, string)
